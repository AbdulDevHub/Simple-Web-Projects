# Simple Firebase Projects

This repository serves as a collection of various Firebase projects. Each project resides in its own dedicated folder. Here's a brief overview of each project:

## [Firebase Add To Cart App](./Firebase%20Add%20To%20Cart%20Web%20App)

This is a simple shopping cart progressive web app I made to test out Firebase Realtime Database. It allows users to store their grocery list in the app through the database, making it easy to remember what they need to buy.

### Features

- **Grocery List**: Users can add items to their grocery list.
- **Realtime Updates**: Changes to the grocery list are updated in real time using Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Persistent Storage**: The grocery list is stored in the database, so it persists even if the app is closed.
